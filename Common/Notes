The light direction has to be relevant to the parent node
Right now


Lights should use the translation : float4x4(translation: skldjf) instead of just a flaot3.
Then i can treat them like model matrixs


// Scene graph - if the car lighting looks weird, its becuase we're moving the lights in GameScene.

// This calculates the flaot3 position of the node
let nodePosition = node.worldTransform.columns.3.xyz

Got claires textures working except the mouth because it should be transparent.
The black parts should be baseColor.a == 0
Works when I check when r == 0, g == 0, b == 0 and then discard fragment
But that .a should come back as 0, so blender is exporting incorreclty or we're interrupting it incorrectly



Try importing a claire with animations and run one of the animations...


Claires textures are backwards compaired to mixamo
